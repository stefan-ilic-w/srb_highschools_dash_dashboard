Project Title: High-Schools Dashboard for Serbia

Project Overview:
The High-Schools Dashboard for Serbia is a comprehensive web application built using Plotly Dash, designed to provide users with a historical overview of various aspects related to high schools across Serbia. This dynamic application sources its data from an Azure SQL database and comprises multiple components, each contributing to an in-depth exploration of high-school data.

Key Project Steps:

1. Data Collection:
The project began with data acquisition, where BeautifulSoup was employed to scrape relevant high-school data. The data was collected from public sources and was initially unstructured.

2. Data Cleaning and Exploration:
Upon data collection, Python Pandas was used for data cleaning and exploration. This process included data transformation, standardization, and the identification of trends and patterns.

3. Database Model Building:
The project's data model was established using SQLAlchemy. This phase entailed designing and defining a database schema that accurately represented the high-school data, including tables, relationships, and constraints.

4. Deploying Data Model and Data:
To support the web application, the data model was deployed to an Azure SQL database. This step involved creating the database tables based on the data model and migrating the cleaned and processed data.

5. Web App Development:
The web application was developed using the Plotly Dash Python library. This dynamic and interactive web interface allows users to access, visualize, and explore the high-school data seamlessly.

6. Web App Deployment:
The completed web application was deployed to an Azure web app server, making it accessible to users. The deployment process ensured that the web app is available on the internet and offers a user-friendly interface for accessing high-school data.

Key Features:

Interactive Dashboard: Users can explore high-school data through interactive charts and graphs.
Historical Overview: The application provides historical insights into aspects such as location, size, educational programs, and student demographics.
Azure SQL Integration: The data is sourced from and stored in an Azure SQL database, ensuring data reliability and scalability.
Data Modeling: A well-structured data model underpins the application, enabling efficient data retrieval and presentation.
User Experience: The project emphasizes a user-friendly experience, with a focus on data visualization and accessibility.
Benefits:
The High-Schools Dashboard for Serbia offers valuable insights to various stakeholders, including educational authorities, parents, and students. It provides an easy-to-navigate platform for understanding trends and patterns within the high-school landscape, aiding in data-informed decision-making.

This project showcases a wide range of skills, from data collection and cleaning to database management and web application development. It is a valuable addition to a portfolio, demonstrating expertise in data processing and visualization, database modeling, and full-stack web development.

Technologies Used:

Python (BeautifulSoup, Pandas, SQLAlchemy)
